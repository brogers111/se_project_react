## Description

The WTWR application provides users with a clothing selection based on the weather in their area, using the Open Weather API. The add clothes modal is accessible in the footer and the profile tabs, allowing users to upload their own clothing items for selection. The clothing item modal also allows users to delete clothing items when necessary. All CRUD operations are done with a mock json-server using the db.json file.
