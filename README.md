# WTWR Project (TripleTen Bootcamp)

## Description

The WTWR application provides users with a clothing selection based on the weather in their area, using the Open Weather API.

The add clothes modal is accessible in the header and the profile tabs, allowing users to upload their own clothing items for selection. The clothing item modal allows users to delete clothing items when necessary. A user is also able to sign up, log in, log out, toggle the temperature scales, and edit their profile information using similarly designed modals.

The backend was built using MongoDB and tested using Postman during development. The site is hosted using a Google Cloud VM instance.
